          <p>Hi! I'm Eugene, from Portland, Oregon, but have lived in Los Angeles for most of my life!</p>

          <p>I've also lived in Brooklyn, New York, and Seoul, Korea. I've moved around quite a bit!

          <p>As a human being, I was once a teenage youth. During this time I attended high school with dreams of pursuing an education in graphic design. As luck would have it, none of my goals were realized!</p>
