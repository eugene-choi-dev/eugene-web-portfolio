      <h3>A Little About Me</h3>

          <p>But as luck would have it, many years later I realized that I indeed wished to pursue a career in a related industry. Albiet not exactly the same thing, or even remotely similar, I decided to quit my job and devote myself to learning the skills of a web developer. I did just that, and I couldn't be more passionate for web development and willing to work with others!

          <p>Anyway, here are some things that I like, in no particular order:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Switching to the Dark Theme on Apps</li>
            <li>Video Games</li>
            <li>Learning to Code</li>
            <li>Cured Meats & Pickled Veggies</li>
          </ul>
          <p> Here are those same interests, but ranked in order of how much I enjoy them:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Video Games</li>
            <li>Learning to Code</li>
            <li>Cured Meats & Pickled Veggies</li>
            <li>Switching to the Dark Theme on Apps</li>
          </ol>
          <p>My goal? Learning to code and following my dreams(involving all the cool stuff listed above)!</p>
